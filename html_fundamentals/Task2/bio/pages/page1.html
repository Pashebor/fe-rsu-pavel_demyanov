<h3>EARLY YEARS (1984–1988)</h3>

<p>Inspired by groups such as Venom, Slayer, Motörhead and Celtic Frost, Mayhem was founded in 1984 by guitarist Øystein Aarseth (known initially as “Destructor”, later “Euronymous”), bassist Jørn Stubberud (“Necrobutcher”) and drummer Kjetil Manheim, taking their band name from the Venom song “Mayhem with Mercy”. This lineup recorded and released the demo Pure Fucking Armageddon. After its release, Aarseth, who used to play lead vocals, along with Stubberud, during first demo’s studio rehearsals, recruited two session vocalists, Eirik Norheim (“Messiah”) and Sven Erik Kristiansen (“Maniac”), in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Norheim played vocals only for a concert, which took place in April 1986 in Ski, and by the end of that year he had quit Mayhem. Whereas, with Kristiansen Mayhem recorded its first EP, Deathcrush, in 1987, and released it through Euronymous’ newly formed label Posercorpse Music.
The initial 1,000 copy release of Deathcrush quickly sold out. It was later reissued in 1993 by the newly renamed Deathlike Silence Productions as a joint venture with Euronymous’ Oslo specialist record shop Helvete (Norwegian for “Hell”). Manheim and Maniac left the band in 1988.</p>

<h3>WITH DEAD (1988–1991)</h3>

<p>After two brief replacements, Manheim and Maniac’s positions were filled by Swedish vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (“Dead”) and local drummer Jan Axel Blomberg (“Hellhammer”). With Dead, the band’s concerts became notorious. For concerts, Dead went to great lengths to achieve the image and atmosphere he wished. From the beginning of his career, he was known to wear “corpse paint”, which involved covering his face with black and white makeup. According to Necrobutcher, “[i]t wasn’t anything to do with the way Kiss and Alice Cooper used makeup. Dead actually wanted to look like a corpse. He didn’t do it to look cool”. Hellhammer claimed that Dead “was the first black metal musician to use corpse paint”. To complete his corpse-like image, Dead would bury his stage clothes and dig them up again to wear on the night of a concert.

While performing Dead would often cut himself with hunting knives and broken glass. Additionally, the band often had pig or sheep heads impaled on stakes and planted at the front of their stage.</p>
