The list should be alphabetized, and to do this place a subscripted number next to each name based on where it will go in the alphabetized list. (Example: Alan 1). Print first, the unalphabetized list with a subscript number next to each name, then the alphabetized list. Both lists should have an &lth1&gt level heading.</li>

    <li>Print some preformatted text of your choosing</li>
